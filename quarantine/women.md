Released under **Jagjaguwar** on **October 7, 2008**, this track stands out for its dreamy, washed-out production and subtle, melancholic melodies. Womenâ€™s mix of post-punk, noise rock, and experimental indie makes them one of the most influential underground bands of the late 2000s.</p> <hr /> <h3>Band Info</h3> <p><strong>Women</strong> â€“ Hailing from **Calgary, Alberta**, Women was a short-lived but highly influential indie band. Featuring **Patrick Flegel (vocals/guitar), Matt Flegel (bass/vocals), Chris Reimer (guitar/vocals), and Michael Wallace (drums)**, their music blends noisy experimentation with melodic, atmospheric songwriting. Their debut album *Women* (2008) and follow-up *Public Strain* (2010) remain essential listens in experimental rock.</p> <hr /> <div> <p>For more exclusive tracks not on Spotify, subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BigBanonos" target="_blank">BigBanonos on YouTube</a> and explore their curated playlist of the best songs <strong>#NotOnSpotify</strong>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtuNtuTatqI0kFahUCbtbfenC_ET5O_tr" target="_blank">Best Songs #NotOnSpotify Playlist</a></p>
