<pre>
Wherever you go
Youâ€™re gonna be alone
And I doubt that youâ€™ll pay
Wrote down the rules you wanted to play Wonâ€™t try to fight for the last time
Wonâ€™t fight cos they just lie Right now I feel that I am found
Right where, I know that I feel the ground Whole world will be the scene
How Iâ€™m gonna know what they see? How Iâ€™m like a dream
Now I know I believe it I really wanna be your guy
Do you wanna beat me up on your side? Whole world is on
The whole world will like that Now mean it when you say
And hold on to words that you play They battle me up in mind
They better be your fight But I can not forget
(no matter whatchu say)
And I will not regret Hold on for life
When itâ€™s too late
And all the signs say
You made it! Please you know I canâ€™t lie
But Iâ€™m sober tonight Where did the view go?
Where did you go, my mate?
Hold on to your home
When yr up at night
Or lose it!
